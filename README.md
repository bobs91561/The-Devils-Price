# Description
A 3D Narrative driven RPG, The Devil's Price takes inspiration from games like Dark Souls, Shadow of War, and Fable. 

The story follows a tormented soul, who suddenly finds themselves in the possession of a powerful artifact capable of cutting through the Gates of Hell and able to restore the player to their former mortal self. The player then ventures into the various Planes of Hell, searching for the other pieces of the artifact with the sole goal of escaping eternal torment. Along the way, the player will encounter Lucifer's greatest allies and strongest fighters. It's up to the player to decide whether they risk fighting these powerful entities or accept their help. But in Hell, everything has a price....
